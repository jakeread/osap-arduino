The [Open Systems Assembly Protocol (OSAP!)](http://osap.tools/) is a new approach for the generation and integration of modular, interoperable hardware systems, and a love letter to computer plumbing and hardware heterogeneity. 

This is the (alpha) arduino library: see [osap.tools](http://osap.tools) for more detail.
